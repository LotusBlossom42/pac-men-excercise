# pacmen
When the "Add Pacman" button is pressed it will create as many pacmen as pressed at random places on the page. When the "Start Game" button is pressed, all pacmen created will start to move around the page at random velocities and going in random directions. They change direction only if they hit a page wall. 

## How to Run
Clone this repo locally (or download zip file) and drag and drop the index.html file into the address bar of your browser. 
Hit enter and the "Add Pacman" and "Start Game" buttons should appear.  

### Roadmap of Future Improvements
I would likely add a "Stop Game" button and functionality as well as a "Delete Pacman" button and functionality.
I would add different css styling to make the page and the pacmen, "pop".
